Example 1:
Tories will support parts of Labour's NHS plan - but with conditions
The Conservatives will support parts of Labour's plan for the NHS but want to see an increase in productivity, the shadow business secretary has said.
Kevin Hollinrake said the Tories "welcome the reforms" but the public sector needs to be more "productive" and "efficient".
"We'll support the Labour government where we can - we want it to succeed," Mr Hollinrake told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.
He said productivity has "flatlined" in recent years but former Tory chancellor Jeremy Hunt "put in place a review which was there to make the NHS more efficient and other parts of the public sector more efficient".
He added: "We spend £1.2tn every year in the public sector, and I say it is around 7% (to) 8% less efficient than it was in 2019, yet we see no plans from Labour to tackle that.
"One way you could have done that, as we have done in the past, is tie pay increases to performance improvements.
"That's what they should have done - that's what they've not done."

Response: OMG I cannot believe this is happening. The Tories are supporting parts of Labour's NHS plan, but with conditions that have nothing to do with what the law is about. Once again, a disappointing day on this cold island.
